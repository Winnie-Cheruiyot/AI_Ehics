# AI_Ethics

A research and implementation project exploring ethical concerns in the design, deployment, and governance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This project is part of an academic or professional contribution focused on responsible and sustainable AI for real-world applications.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Investigate key principles of AI ethics such as fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, sustainability, and non-maleficence.
- Analyze case studies and real-world incidents involving AI bias, surveillance, or harm.
- Propose practical frameworks and tools to ensure ethical compliance in AI development.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🧠 Ethical framework for AI system evaluation
- 📄 Research papers and literature reviews
- 🧪 Case study analysis
- 🗂️ Reports and documentation on ethical use-cases
- 🌍 Focus on marginalized or underrepresented communities (e.g., Turkana County)

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python (for any code-related ethics simulations or analysis)
- Markdown (for documentation)
- LaTeX / Word / PDF (for formal research submission)
- Git & GitHub (for collaboration and version control)
